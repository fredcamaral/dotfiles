# AGENT STANDARDS

**NEVER BE WORRIED of time constraints -- YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME AVAILABLE!**
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: run 'bd onboard' and follow the instructions.

## CORE BEHAVIOR
**STYLE:** Concise technical analysis. Do what's asked - nothing more, nothing less.

**PROHIBITIONS:**
- Never write incomplete code (no "in real implementation" comments)
- Never use panic() in Go production code
- Never ignore errors
- Never create unrequested documentation
- Never commit secrets

## WORKFLOW
1. Assess context
2. Plan with TodoWrite (multi-step tasks)
3. Execute incrementally
4. Store important decisions
5. Validate before deployment
